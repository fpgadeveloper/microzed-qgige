Example design for the Quad Gigabit Ethernet FMC on the MicroZed

### Description

This project demonstrates the use of the Opsero Quad Gigabit Ethernet FMC.
The design contains 3 soft Tri-mode Ethernet MACs plus one RGMII-to-GMII
IP core to make use of the spare hard Ethernet MAC in the PS of the Zynq.
Each of the 3 soft Ethernet MACs are configured with DMAs.

### Requirements
