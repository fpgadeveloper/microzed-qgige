Example design for the [Quad Gigabit Ethernet FMC](http://ethernetfmc.com "Ethernet FMC") on the [MicroZed](http://microzed.org "MicroZed")

### Description

This project demonstrates the use of the Opsero Quad Gigabit Ethernet FMC.
The design contains 3 soft Tri-mode Ethernet MACs plus one RGMII-to-GMII
IP core to make use of the spare hard Ethernet MAC in the PS of the Zynq.
Each of the 3 soft Ethernet MACs are configured with DMAs.

### Requirements

* Vivado 2014.2
* [Ethernet FMC](http://ethernetfmc.com "Ethernet FMC")
* [MicroZed](http://microzed.org "MicroZed")

### License
